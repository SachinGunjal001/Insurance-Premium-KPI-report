# Insurance Premium KPI report
An interactive Power BI Dashboard for an Insurance Company, analyzing premium collections, payouts, investments, and policyholder insights. Built using Power BI and Excel, this project demonstrates data modelling, DAX, and business intelligence to track KPIs, visualise trends, and support data-driven decisions.



In DXC, I used clustering to categorize insurance clients by premium value and claim frequency for personalized outreach.
